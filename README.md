# Fern

Fern is an open source framework that makes it easier to build APIs.

Fern allows you to

1. Define a source-of-truth for your API
2. Autogenerate idiomatic & typesafe clients and servers
3. Supports WebSocket and REST APIs
4. Easily manage backwards compatiblity

Fern is interoperable with Open API so you are never locked in.
